# Maki Translations
**Hello!**

If you want to help me and translate Maki to more languages or fix mistakes in existing ones - you are welcome!

You can improve existing translations by clicking on "edit" button and opening pull requests or translate to new languages by modifying `English.xml` in your fork.

Don't forget to write which language it is.

You can always notify me directly about new translation here to speed up a process:
